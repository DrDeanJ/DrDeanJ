       <h2>Biofluidic Research Lab Research</h2>
       <p class="split">
        There were more than 725,000 patients with end-stage renal disease
        (ESRD) in the US in 2016 with ~124,000 new cases reported. The standard
        of care for ESRD patients is lifelong hemodialysis (HD) treatments at a
        frequency of three times per week with 63% of prevalent ESRD cases
        undergoing HD in 2016. In-center thrice-weekly treatments have been
        linked with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
        events and mortality due to the extra-long interdialytic period. Post
        dialysis recovery time can be twice as long as the treatment time,
        during which time patients report feeling ill, rundown, and depressed,
        which prevents most patients from holding a full-time job. Life
        expectancies for ESRD patients have improved little in the past two
        decades, with almost no change ( &lt; 1 year increase) for those 50 years
        of age and older. In an effort to improve both health outcomes and the
        quality of life for those on HD my lab (supported by K25 & R01 grants
        from NIH/NDIKK) is working on technologies to enable portable or
        wearable HD. Such advances would not only provide lifestyle benefits in
        the form of mobility and convenience, they should improve treatment
        outcomes by enabling more frequent or continuous dialysis and minimizing
        extracorporeal blood circuit volumes. The best hope for a healthier
        future for ESRD patients, short of a replacement kidney, is the
        emergence of disruptive technologies in HD therapy. Ultimately systems
        would include a plasma filter, followed by an active filter that uses
        cultured cells and could include inline metrology of blood components.
        The goal of my lab will be to develop MEMS technologies and devices for
        medical sensors, diagnostics, and therapies.
